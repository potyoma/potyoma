##### I'm learning programming to get a job as a software engineer currently. Web development has taken my interest 
##### at first sight. As a hobby I learn game development and try to make some games on my own. 
##### Feel free to look at my project and write if you have any ideas.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [this](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/rYyhwJAxMfES5jNQ9YsP) project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning .NET Core, C#, Unity, TS, React, SQL and Python.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: just send me an email to artyomnovosyolov254@gmail.com or nov-art-s@ya.ru
- âš¡ Fun fact: Those dark times when .NET only worked on Windows has passed. Relax and use Linux.
